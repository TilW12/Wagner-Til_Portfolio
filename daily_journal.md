Today I started work on my senior engineering project. I am building a coffee table that will have an automatic water pouring system so when you put a glass on the cupholder it will pour water into it. Today I designed a simple coffee table on fusion 360. I used tools such as loft, rectangular pattern, and extrtude. I have learned to use these tools in previous classes at latin.
